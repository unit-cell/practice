## practice
Musical scale quiz for monome norns, to practice scales on the piano or any other instrument.

The script will name a scale for the user to play, and there is an option to reveal a small two-octave piano keyboard with the keys of said scale highlighted.

Three modes are currently implemented, but it is very easy to add more! 
(1) Major and minor scales
(2) Modes
(3) Major/minor pentatonic scales

## requirements
norns or equivalent

## documentation
Encoder 2: scroll between modes
Key 2: reveal keyboard
Key 3: reroll for a new scale
